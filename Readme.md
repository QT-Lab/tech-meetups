# Tech meetups

At Quality Tech Lab, we have technical meetups every now and then. This repo may serve as a repo for the planned and occasional coding, as well as a forum for deciding on the topics of the meetups /via issues/.

Below is the list of projects, it contains.

## Hello, World!

This is a bundle of _Hello, World!_ examples in Scala, Python, GAS, and C.

## Artaki mot

Is a simple REST API example in JavaScript. A couple of tests are provided, in Python.

## Q&A topics

Issues are used as a forum for proposing and voting on the topics of the meetups. If you'd like to discuss a topic, please create an issue and put the _Q&A_ label on it.

When proposing a topic, remember:

* _What is interesting for you, may not be interesting for others_ - Don't lose your heart, if your topics do not generate enough traction. It just may be that the topics you suggest are too specific, so try to find common ground with your peers. Or, maybe, just try blackmailing them.

* _Remembering things is hard_ - Topics may take some time before being discussed at a meetup. This is due to the fact that we tend to forget /important/ things when we do not use them /of course, except riding a bicycle/. In order to make the discussion informative, we need to look up a bunch of stuff. On rare occasions, when the topic relevant experience is still fresh, the topics may be discussed immediately.

* _General questions assume general answers_ - When asking a question, be aware that, the answer will be as specific. To get the best out of our discussions, try to provide context and define scopes /personal experiences or specific cases that may be of help/ when proposing a topic. Mention references and related material you studied or shuffled through.

* _Our meetings have time constraints_ - Our meetings currently do not have a predefined schedule, so we can move them to our needs. To achieve this we try to keep our meetings around an hour long. This means that _longer_ topics may stretch over a few of them. This length is also taken into account when choosing a topic for the next meeting, and shorter topics will be favored over longer ones.

The points above may make us more effective. Nevertheless, don't hesitate to post a topic, even if you feel it is _incomplete_. We can work on it together, refining it as we go.
