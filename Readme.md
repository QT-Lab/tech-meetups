# Tech meetups

At Quality Tech Lab, we have technical meetups every now and then. This repo may serve as a repo for the planned and occasional coding, as well as a forum for deciding on the topics of the meetups /via issues/.

Below is the list of projects, it contains.

## Hello, World!

This is a bundle of _Hello, World!_ examples in Scala, Python, GAS and C.

## Artaki mot

Is a simple REST API example in JavaScript. A couple of tests are provided, in Python. 

## Q&A topics

Issues are used as a forum for proposing and voting on the topics of the meetups. If you'd like to discuss a topic, please create an issue and put the _Q&A_ label on it.
